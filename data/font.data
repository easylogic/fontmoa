Soon everybody wanted it. In due course, extra-bold extra-condensed faces for families like Helvetica began to appear, looking remarkably like the original Schmalfette. \r\nPhotoscript had made a lowercase version quite early on. Later, they made a less condensed version and called it Haettenschweiler Extended as a tribute to a designer whose idea so greatly affected the graphic scene in the second half of the century.

Originally, Elephant appeared in posters, often alternating from roman to italic on successive lines. In Europe, faces of this kind still may be used in very small sizes for telephone numbers in letterheads and business cards. Today, the best use of Elephant is for an eye-catching word.

Originally issued in only one weight, the ATF version of Franklin Gothic was eventually expanded to include five additional weights, but no light or intermediate weights were ever developed. In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Heavy","currentLanguage":"en","italic":true,"collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Heavy","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"2BOhqsYtM58l0tJy"}

Originally issued in only one weight, the ATF version of Franklin Gothic was eventually expanded to include five additional weights, but no light or intermediate weights were ever developed. In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

The slab serifs, or Egyptians, originated in the nineteenth century when they were used principally for display work.

In more recent years this style of typeface has been increasingly used for text setting where their even colour and visual impact can be fully exploited."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Rockwell","currentLanguage":"en","italic":true,"bold":true,"collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Rockwell","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"7rnfR4ui82Vt4otr"}

Originally issued in only one weight, the ATF version of Franklin Gothic was eventually expanded to include five additional weights, but no light or intermediate weights were ever developed. In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet.

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Demi","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Demi","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"D1QSVZ4UOMWgmnWS"}

The slab serifs, or Egyptians, originated in the nineteenth century when they were used principally for display work. Rockwell is notable for its judiciously clipped slab serifs, and is given a particular sparkle by means of its angular terminals. In more recent years this style of typeface has been increasingly used for text setting where their even colour and visual impact can be fully exploited."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Rockwell Condensed","currentLanguage":"en","bold":true,"collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Rockwell Condensed","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"EXjiXUFbG766jH0a"}

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Medium","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Medium","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"LCEywE62xq93RciP"}

Each of its six styles has been designed to excel at a specific size. The smaller styles are workhorses, highly legible in text, with sturdy structures and generous spacing. At the upper end of the size range Sitka’s styles have a warm and elegant personality with the narrower forms and tighter spacing appropriate for display. Used in concert, the Sitka typeface family brings readability, visual interest and typographic consistency to the page and screen.  ¶ In a new and unique methodology, scientific legibility studies were directly integrated into the Sitka design process. Different versions of each letter were tested in recognition studies, and the results were incorporated into the final design.  ¶ This approach of combining science, technology, and craftsmanship to produce an excellent reading experience on screen was pioneered at Microsoft by Bill Hill. As a member of the Typography and Advanced Reading Technology teams, Bill revolutionized on-screen typography by championing the creation of the OpenType specification, ClearType rendering technology, and landmark typefaces such as Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, and Meiryo. Microsoft’s typography teams dedicate the Sitka family of typefaces to the memory of Bill Hill and his vision of Reading 2.0. His passion and values live on in the design of this typeface family."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.carterandcone.com"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

Renamed, reorganized, and released in 1992 as Microsoft Wingdings, the three fonts provide a harmoniously designed set of icons representing the common components of personal computer systems and the elements of graphical user interfaces. \r\n\r\nThere are icons for PC, monitor, keyboard, mouse, trackball, hard drive, diskette, tape cassette, printer, fax, etc., as well as icons for file folders, documents, mail, mailboxes, windows, clipboard, and wastebasket. In addition, Wingdings includes icons with both traditional and computer significance, such as writing tools and hands, reading glasses, clipping scissors, bell, bomb, check boxes, as well as more traditional images such as weather signs, religious symbols, astrological signs, encircled numerals, a selection of ampersands and interrobangs, plus elegant flowers and flourishes. \r\n\r\nPointing and indicating are frequent functions in graphical interfaces, so in addition to a wide selection of pointing hands, the Wingdings fonts also offer arrows in careful gradations of weight and different directions and styles. For variety and impact as bullets, asterisks, and ornaments, Windings also offers a varied set of geometric circles, squares, polygons, targets, and stars."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/fonts/wingdings/"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

Originally issued in only one weight, the ATF version of Franklin Gothic was eventually expanded to include five additional weights, but no light or intermediate weights were ever developed. In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Demi Cond","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Demi Cond","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"Tn2y9N3ynPRO2zDP"}

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Demi","currentLanguage":"en","italic":true,"collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Demi","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"Xe4FVIymU2e36ICm"}

Each of its six styles has been designed to excel at a specific size. The smaller styles are workhorses, highly legible in text, with sturdy structures and generous spacing. At the upper end of the size range Sitka’s styles have a warm and elegant personality with the narrower forms and tighter spacing appropriate for display. Used in concert, the Sitka typeface family brings readability, visual interest and typographic consistency to the page and screen.  ¶ In a new and unique methodology, scientific legibility studies were directly integrated into the Sitka design process. Different versions of each letter were tested in recognition studies, and the results were incorporated into the final design.  ¶ This approach of combining science, technology, and craftsmanship to produce an excellent reading experience on screen was pioneered at Microsoft by Bill Hill. As a member of the Typography and Advanced Reading Technology teams, Bill revolutionized on-screen typography by championing the creation of the OpenType specification, ClearType rendering technology, and landmark typefaces such as Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, and Meiryo. Microsoft’s typography teams dedicate the Sitka family of typefaces to the memory of Bill Hill and his vision of Reading 2.0. His passion and values live on in the design of this typeface family."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.carterandcone.com"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

Grimshaw claims that every calligrapher's aspiration is to render Roman capitals perfectly with a pen, but admits that it is very difficult to do. For ITC Tempus™ he used a fountain pen on cheap, porous paper, and as you would expect, the ink bled. The resulting letterforms are classically based, but have rugged edges, so they deviate from the 'preciousness' of hand lettered romans. Released in 1996, ITC Tempus is a parody of a classical roman design. It is dictated by proportions, particularly those of capitals. The lowercase is somewhat loose and uninhibited. \"Tempus Sans is just Tempus with the serifs surgically removed,\" Grimshaw says. \"Yet the proportions of the characters work nicely.\" Because of its toughness, the typeface works best at larger point sizes, yet maintains its characters when set at small sizes. You might consider it a \"punk roman\" that works where a roman face is desired, but the fine edge is not."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Tempus Sans ITC","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Tempus Sans ITC","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"cLIWQVYDVpuKJnBY"}

Form and function became the key words, unnecessary decoration was scorned. This clean cut, sans serif with geometric shapes was most appropriate. The lighter weights can be used for text setting, the bold and condensed fonts are suitable for display in headlines and advertising."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Tw Cen MT","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Tw Cen MT","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"eBYA2QA1t7QL58cG"}

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Heavy","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Heavy","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"eZkavQYkpcVwVv6W"}

Used in concert, the Sitka typeface family brings readability, visual interest and typographic consistency to the page and screen.  ¶ In a new and unique methodology, scientific legibility studies were directly integrated into the Sitka design process. Different versions of each letter were tested in recognition studies, and the results were incorporated into the final design.  ¶ This approach of combining science, technology, and craftsmanship to produce an excellent reading experience on screen was pioneered at Microsoft by Bill Hill. As a member of the Typography and Advanced Reading Technology teams, Bill revolutionized on-screen typography by championing the creation of the OpenType specification, ClearType rendering technology, and landmark typefaces such as Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, and Meiryo.

This typeface is based on roman types cut by Jean Jannon in 1615. Jannon followed the designs of Claude Garamond which had been cut in the previous century. Garamond's types were, in turn, based on those used by Aldus Manutius in 1495 and cut by Francesco Griffo. The italic is based on types cut in France circa 1557 by Robert Granjon. Garamond is a beautiful typeface with an air of informality which looks good in a wide range of applications. It works particularly well in books and lengthy text settings."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"},"license":{"en":"NOTIFICATION OF LICENSE AGREEMENT\r\n\r\nThis typeface is the property of Monotype Typography and its use by you is covered under the terms of a license agreement.

Each of its six styles has been designed to excel at a specific size. The smaller styles are workhorses, highly legible in text, with sturdy structures and generous spacing. At the upper end of the size range Sitka’s styles have a warm and elegant personality with the narrower forms and tighter spacing appropriate for display. Used in concert, the Sitka typeface family brings readability, visual interest and typographic consistency to the page and screen.  ¶ In a new and unique methodology, scientific legibility studies were directly integrated into the Sitka design process. Different versions of each letter were tested in recognition studies, and the results were incorporated into the final design.  ¶ This approach of combining science, technology, and craftsmanship to produce an excellent reading experience on screen was pioneered at Microsoft by Bill Hill. As a member of the Typography and Advanced Reading Technology teams, Bill revolutionized on-screen typography by championing the creation of the OpenType specification, ClearType rendering technology, and landmark typefaces such as Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, and Meiryo. Microsoft’s typography teams dedicate the Sitka family of typefaces to the memory of Bill Hill and his vision of Reading 2.0. His passion and values live on in the design of this typeface family."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.carterandcone.com"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Book","currentLanguage":"en","italic":true,"collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Book","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"tBYpgkw3MjMJCot6"}

Many American foundries made versions of this type which eventually became known as Bookman. Monotype Bookman Old Style roman is based on earlier Lanston Monotype and ATF models.

These became Monotype series 231, produced in 1923, and the forerunner of the extensive Gill Sans range now available. A twentieth century sans serif that has a simplicity of form which does not reject traditional forms and proportions, and gives the face a humanist feel. The lighter weights are highly readable in text and suitable for magazine and book work, whereas the heavier weights are best used for display in advertising, packaging, and labels."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Gill Sans Ultra Bold","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Gill Sans Ultra Bold","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"tr8PsjlDZPTWYfFW"}

Although many of Oz Cooper's letterform designs were cast in metal type, this particular one was not. \r\n\r\nThe weights for the Maiandra family were selected for their versatility in usage over a broad range of output device resolutions. Indeed, \"the consideration of eventual display resolutions, be they for screen or printer, provided the greatest challenge in the design of this typeface family,\" explains Dennis. Creating shapes that conform to the rigors of digital letterforms and modern rendering environments, without losing the unique characteristics of Oz Cooper's original design, is what Dennis has accomplished with his tribute to this great designer of the past. \r\n\r\nMaiandra, whose name derives from the Greek 'maiandros', meaning 'meander,' is intended for extended text use, as well as for informal subject matter, such as business correspondence, brochures and broadsides. \"An example of a good use for Maiandra,\" notes Dennis, \"is in printed matter relating to the turn-of-the-century art period known as the Arts and Crafts Movement. It can stand alone or be used with designs that complement its shape and color.\""},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.galapagosdesign.com/"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.galapagosdesign.com/staff/dennis.htm"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.galapagosdesign.com/"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Maiandra GD","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Maiandra GD","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"vj8SFlNOARdjJHMz"}

Originally issued in only one weight, the ATF version of Franklin Gothic was eventually expanded to include five additional weights, but no light or intermediate weights were ever developed. In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Book","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Book","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"xxPE3KqQgxu249kQ"}
