Gill studied under the renowned calligrapher, Edward Johnston, the designer of the London Underground sans serif typeface. This influenced Gill who later experimented with sans serif designs, and in due course produced a set of capital letters. These became Monotype series 231, produced in 1923, and the forerunner of the extensive Gill Sans range now available. A twentieth century sans serif that has a simplicity of form which does not reject traditional forms and proportions, and gives the face a humanist feel. The lighter weights are highly readable in text and suitable for magazine and book work, whereas the heavier weights are best used for display in advertising, packaging, and labels."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Gill Sans MT Condensed","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Gill Sans MT Condensed","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"1ngLIEUhiD0hm18N"}

A contemporary sans serif design, Arial contains more humanist characteristics than many of its predecessors and as such is more in tune with the mood of the last decades of the twentieth century. The overall treatment of curves is softer and fuller than in most industrial-style sans serif faces. Terminal strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical appearance. Arial is an extremely versatile family of typefaces which can be used with equal success for text setting in reports, presentations, magazines etc, and for display use in newspapers, advertising and promotions."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

In 2000, the expert and old style figure font sets were finally released, and in 2002 a new titling font was added to round out the family.

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Medium Cond","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Medium Cond","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"4TXLDV8oILkr5bmv"}

In addition, Wingdings includes icons with both traditional and computer significance, such as writing tools and hands, reading glasses, clipping scissors, bell, bomb, check boxes, as well as more traditional images such as weather signs, religious symbols, astrological signs, encircled numerals, a selection of ampersands and interrobangs, plus elegant flowers and flourishes. \r\n\r\nPointing and indicating are frequent functions in graphical interfaces, so in addition to a wide selection of pointing hands, the Wingdings fonts also offer arrows in careful gradations of weight and different directions and styles. For variety and impact as bullets, asterisks, and ornaments, Windings also offers a varied set of geometric circles, squares, polygons, targets, and stars."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/fonts/wingdings/"},"license":{"en":"You may use this font as permitted by the EULA for the product in which this font is included to display and print content.

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Heavy","currentLanguage":"en","italic":true,"collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Heavy","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"5dp6XRJ3p1eQjwCi"}

A contemporary sans serif design, Arial contains more humanist characteristics than many of its predecessors and as such is more in tune with the mood of the last decades of the twentieth century. The overall treatment of curves is softer and fuller than in most industrial-style sans serif faces. Terminal strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical appearance.

Each of its six styles has been designed to excel at a specific size. The smaller styles are workhorses, highly legible in text, with sturdy structures and generous spacing. At the upper end of the size range Sitka’s styles have a warm and elegant personality with the narrower forms and tighter spacing appropriate for display. Used in concert, the Sitka typeface family brings readability, visual interest and typographic consistency to the page and screen.  ¶ In a new and unique methodology, scientific legibility studies were directly integrated into the Sitka design process. Different versions of each letter were tested in recognition studies, and the results were incorporated into the final design.  ¶ This approach of combining science, technology, and craftsmanship to produce an excellent reading experience on screen was pioneered at Microsoft by Bill Hill. As a member of the Typography and Advanced Reading Technology teams, Bill revolutionized on-screen typography by championing the creation of the OpenType specification, ClearType rendering technology, and landmark typefaces such as Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, and Meiryo. Microsoft’s typography teams dedicate the Sitka family of typefaces to the memory of Bill Hill and his vision of Reading 2.0. His passion and values live on in the design of this typeface family."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.carterandcone.com"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Demi","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Demi","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"Az3ugPRifpyu1slW"}

His work ranges from newspaper typefaces for Mergenthaler Linotype to the condensed sans typeface now used more than any other in re-designed telephone books. His Galliard became one of the most popular new text faces of the last 20 years. Now we have Elephant and its italic, a careful re-working of a traditional English extra-bold serif style. Originally, Elephant appeared in posters, often alternating from roman to italic on successive lines. In Europe, faces of this kind still may be used in very small sizes for telephone numbers in letterheads and business cards. Today, the best use of Elephant is for an eye-catching word. Even a single quote will draw the reader's eye to where it is placed.\r\n"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Elephant","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Elephant","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"G3J1xF2HSaexqZj6"}

The slab serifs, or Egyptians, originated in the nineteenth century when they were used principally for display work.

In more recent years this style of typeface has been increasingly used for text setting where their even colour and visual impact can be fully exploited."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Rockwell Extra Bold","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Rockwell Extra Bold","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"HMnfuuDPsUKPiHAm"}

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

Between 1908 and 1917 he designed thousands of books for Munich publishers in a refined traditional style. In the early 1920s he began to support the modern styles of architecture and typography, becoming a leading proponent of the New Typography. Renner is best known for designing the typeface Futura, which became a standard tool for the New Typography, and remains a popular typeface today. Futura does give a restful, almost bland impression, which accords with Renner's objectives. Futura seems classical, not only due to the form of its capitals, but also to the open, wide forms of the geometrical small letters. The typeface relies on notions of classical, yet contemporary form, - harmony and evenness of texture.  Thanks to the modern digital technology Futura lives on in a greater variety than ever, offering a wide choice of typographic solutions for contemporary design in the new millennium."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.neufville.com"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.neufville.com"},"fontFeatures":{"256":{"en":"All Typographic Features"},"257":{"en":"All Features"},"258":{"en":"Ligatures"},"259":{"en":"Common Ligatures"},"260":{"en":"NULL"},"261":{"en":"NULL"},"262":{"en":"NULL"}}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Futura","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Futura","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"M6Nb0enUYi42yheP"}

PT Serif coordinates with PT Sans on metrics, proportions, weights and design. It consists of six styles: regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard computer font family; two caption styles (regular and italic) are for texts of small point sizes. The letterforms are distinguished by large x-height, modest stroke contrast, robust wedge-like serifs, and triangular terminals. Due to these features the face can be qualified as matched to modern trends of type design and of enhanced legibility. Mentioned characteristics beside conventional use in business applications and printed stuff make the fonts quite useable for advertising and display typography.\r\nEach font next to standard Latin and Cyrillic character sets contains alphabet glyphs of title languages of the national republics of Russian Federation and support the most of the languages of neighboring countries. The fonts were developed and released by ParaType in 2010 with financial support from Federal Agency of Print and Mass Communications of Russian Federation.

Originally issued in only one weight, the ATF version of Franklin Gothic was eventually expanded to include five additional weights, but no light or intermediate weights were ever developed. In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Demi","currentLanguage":"en","italic":true,"collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Demi","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"O1X9EJpXVNmw85uB"}

Each of its six styles has been designed to excel at a specific size. The smaller styles are workhorses, highly legible in text, with sturdy structures and generous spacing. At the upper end of the size range Sitka’s styles have a warm and elegant personality with the narrower forms and tighter spacing appropriate for display. Used in concert, the Sitka typeface family brings readability, visual interest and typographic consistency to the page and screen.  ¶ In a new and unique methodology, scientific legibility studies were directly integrated into the Sitka design process. Different versions of each letter were tested in recognition studies, and the results were incorporated into the final design.  ¶ This approach of combining science, technology, and craftsmanship to produce an excellent reading experience on screen was pioneered at Microsoft by Bill Hill. As a member of the Typography and Advanced Reading Technology teams, Bill revolutionized on-screen typography by championing the creation of the OpenType specification, ClearType rendering technology, and landmark typefaces such as Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, and Meiryo. Microsoft’s typography teams dedicate the Sitka family of typefaces to the memory of Bill Hill and his vision of Reading 2.0. His passion and values live on in the design of this typeface family."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.carterandcone.com"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

They were printers, publishers, typeface designers, inventors and intellectuals. Around 1800 the Didot family owned the most important print shop and font foundry in France. Pierre Didot, the printer, published a document with the typefaces of his brother, Firmin Didot, the typeface designer.  The strong clear forms of this alphabet display objective, rational characteristics and are representative of the time and philosophy of the Enlightenment. Adrian Frutiger's Didot is a sensitive interpretation of the French Modern Face Didot. Another model for this design is the Henriade, a historical printing of the original Didot from 1818. The font Didot gives text a classic and elegant feel."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.LinotypeLibrary.com/"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.LinotypeLibrary.com/"}},"language":["256","257","258","259","260","261","262","263","264","265","266"],"currentFamilyName":"Didot","currentLanguage":"266","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Didot","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"UU9IGltWQaEPnJde"}

Used in concert, the Sitka typeface family brings readability, visual interest and typographic consistency to the page and screen.  ¶ In a new and unique methodology, scientific legibility studies were directly integrated into the Sitka design process. Different versions of each letter were tested in recognition studies, and the results were incorporated into the final design.  ¶ This approach of combining science, technology, and craftsmanship to produce an excellent reading experience on screen was pioneered at Microsoft by Bill Hill. As a member of the Typography and Advanced Reading Technology teams, Bill revolutionized on-screen typography by championing the creation of the OpenType specification, ClearType rendering technology, and landmark typefaces such as Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, and Meiryo. Microsoft’s typography teams dedicate the Sitka family of typefaces to the memory of Bill Hill and his vision of Reading 2.0.

In addition, Wingdings includes icons with both traditional and computer significance, such as writing tools and hands, reading glasses, clipping scissors, bell, bomb, check boxes, as well as more traditional images such as weather signs, religious symbols, astrological signs, encircled numerals, a selection of ampersands and interrobangs, plus elegant flowers and flourishes. \r\n\r\nPointing and indicating are frequent functions in graphical interfaces, so in addition to a wide selection of pointing hands, the Wingdings fonts also offer arrows in careful gradations of weight and different directions and styles. For variety and impact as bullets, asterisks, and ornaments, Windings also offers a varied set of geometric circles, squares, polygons, targets, and stars."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/fonts/wingdings/"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Heavy","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Heavy","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"bttSYShtWKZ0JYJB"}

Grimshaw claims that every calligrapher's aspiration is to render Roman capitals perfectly with a pen, but admits that it is very difficult to do. For ITC Tempus™ he used a fountain pen on cheap, porous paper, and as you would expect, the ink bled. The resulting letterforms are classically based, but have rugged edges, so they deviate from the 'preciousness' of hand lettered romans. Released in 1996, ITC Tempus is a parody of a classical roman design. It is dictated by proportions, particularly those of capitals. The lowercase is somewhat loose and uninhibited. \"Tempus Sans is just Tempus with the serifs surgically removed,\" Grimshaw says. \"Yet the proportions of the characters work nicely.\" Because of its toughness, the typeface works best at larger point sizes, yet maintains its characters when set at small sizes. You might consider it a \"punk roman\" that works where a roman face is desired, but the fine edge is not."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Tempus Sans ITC","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Tempus Sans ITC","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"gNh1OYP5Uq0BBaGT"}

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Medium","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Medium","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"jw1202lr5moIFMNQ"}

Large scale drawings by Gill were given to Charles Malin, a Parisian punch-cutter, and his hand cut punches were the basis for the font issued by Monotype. The incised quality of Perpetua will lend distinction to any work compatible with its serenity. First used in a private translation called 'The Passion of Perpetua and Felicity'; the italic was originally called Felicity. Widely used as a text face in quality books, Perpetua is also very popular in advertising and display work."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Perpetua","currentLanguage":"en","italic":true,"bold":true,"collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Perpetua","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"koGLVztuWyWMiUv7"}

PT Serif coordinates with PT Sans on metrics, proportions, weights and design. It consists of six styles: regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard computer font family; two caption styles (regular and italic) are for texts of small point sizes. The letterforms are distinguished by large x-height, modest stroke contrast, robust wedge-like serifs, and triangular terminals. Due to these features the face can be qualified as matched to modern trends of type design and of enhanced legibility. Mentioned characteristics beside conventional use in business applications and printed stuff make the fonts quite useable for advertising and display typography.\r\nEach font next to standard Latin and Cyrillic character sets contains alphabet glyphs of title languages of the national republics of Russian Federation and support the most of the languages of neighboring countries. The fonts were developed and released by ParaType in 2010 with financial support from Federal Agency of Print and Mass Communications of Russian Federation.

Schmalfette Grotesk was a very condensed, very bold alphabet of all capitals – schmalfette means \"bold condensed\" in German, and grotesk indicates it is without serifs.\r\nIt was immediately picked up by designers at Paris Match who cut up pictures of it to make headlines. Soon everybody wanted it. In due course, extra-bold extra-condensed faces for families like Helvetica began to appear, looking remarkably like the original Schmalfette. \r\nPhotoscript had made a lowercase version quite early on. Later, they made a less condensed version and called it Haettenschweiler Extended as a tribute to a designer whose idea so greatly affected the graphic scene in the second half of the century. Use this distinguished face in large sizes for headlines.\r\n"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Haettenschweiler","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Haettenschweiler","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"myXPcZVtXoS9lXqs"}

Each of its six styles has been designed to excel at a specific size. The smaller styles are workhorses, highly legible in text, with sturdy structures and generous spacing. At the upper end of the size range Sitka’s styles have a warm and elegant personality with the narrower forms and tighter spacing appropriate for display. Used in concert, the Sitka typeface family brings readability, visual interest and typographic consistency to the page and screen.  ¶ In a new and unique methodology, scientific legibility studies were directly integrated into the Sitka design process. Different versions of each letter were tested in recognition studies, and the results were incorporated into the final design.  ¶ This approach of combining science, technology, and craftsmanship to produce an excellent reading experience on screen was pioneered at Microsoft by Bill Hill. As a member of the Typography and Advanced Reading Technology teams, Bill revolutionized on-screen typography by championing the creation of the OpenType specification, ClearType rendering technology, and landmark typefaces such as Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, and Meiryo. Microsoft’s typography teams dedicate the Sitka family of typefaces to the memory of Bill Hill and his vision of Reading 2.0. His passion and values live on in the design of this typeface family."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.carterandcone.com"},"license":{"en":"Microsoft supplied font.

Garamond's types were, in turn, based on those used by Aldus Manutius in 1495 and cut by Francesco Griffo. The italic is based on types cut in France circa 1557 by Robert Granjon. Garamond is a beautiful typeface with an air of informality which looks good in a wide range of applications. It works particularly well in books and lengthy text settings."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/mtname/ms_welcome.html"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.monotype.com/html/designer/des_index.html"},"license":{"en":"NOTIFICATION OF LICENSE AGREEMENT\r\n\r\nThis typeface is the property of Monotype Typography and its use by you is covered under the terms of a license agreement.

Although many of Oz Cooper's letterform designs were cast in metal type, this particular one was not. \r\n\r\nThe weights for the Maiandra family were selected for their versatility in usage over a broad range of output device resolutions. Indeed, \"the consideration of eventual display resolutions, be they for screen or printer, provided the greatest challenge in the design of this typeface family,\" explains Dennis. Creating shapes that conform to the rigors of digital letterforms and modern rendering environments, without losing the unique characteristics of Oz Cooper's original design, is what Dennis has accomplished with his tribute to this great designer of the past. \r\n\r\nMaiandra, whose name derives from the Greek 'maiandros', meaning 'meander,' is intended for extended text use, as well as for informal subject matter, such as business correspondence, brochures and broadsides. \"An example of a good use for Maiandra,\" notes Dennis, \"is in printed matter relating to the turn-of-the-century art period known as the Arts and Crafts Movement. It can stand alone or be used with designs that complement its shape and color.\""},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.galapagosdesign.com/"},"designerURL":{"en":"http://www.galapagosdesign.com/staff/dennis.htm"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.galapagosdesign.com/"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Maiandra GD","currentLanguage":"en","collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Maiandra GD","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"xPOgAYlbupCzWiuv"}

Originally issued in only one weight, the ATF version of Franklin Gothic was eventually expanded to include five additional weights, but no light or intermediate weights were ever developed. In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design."},"vendorURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com"},"license":{"en":"Please contact the vendor to learn more about license restrictions."},"licenseURL":{"en":"http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/licensing.html"}},"language":["en"],"currentFamilyName":"Franklin Gothic Book","currentLanguage":"en","italic":true,"collectStyle":{"fontFamily":"Franklin Gothic Book","fontWeight":"normal"},"_id":"ysp7QiKz91pCEpje"}
